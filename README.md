# 🏫 School Project: 🔍 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

## 📊 Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for predicting House Price Index (HPI) based on Age and Loan amount. It's designed for educational purposes as part of a Data Mining subject assignment, providing clear understanding of distance calculations and classification using KNN.

## 📝 How it works

The algorithm:
1. Takes a dataset of known cases with Age, Loan, and HPI values
2. Normalizes all numerical features using min-max scaling
3. Calculates the Euclidean distance between an unknown case and all data points
4. Can be used to predict the HPI of the unknown case using the nearest neighbors

## 🚀 Usage

Run the script to see the detailed calculations and the final distance table:

```
python knn.py
```

The closest neighbors (smallest distance values) can be used to predict the HPI for the new entry.
